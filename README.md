# Bukk.it.i.zer

A powerful bukk.it retrieval API crafted carefully to provide appropriate images for all situations, should Ethan Marcotte not be available for the task.

**If, and only if, Ethan Marcotte is not available to provide the right GIF for any occasion**, you can issue the HTTP requests listed below, all of which redirect, if possible, to a bukk.it URL. To see it in action, you can try http://bukkit.tangentialism.com/, but don't get your hopes up.

## Methods

### `GET /`

Returns a random image of any format.

`http://bukkit.tangentialism.com/`

### `GET /MATCHABLE-WORD.FORMAT`

Returns a random image whose name includes _MATCHABLE-WORD_ of format _FORMAT_. So, `GET /cat.gif` would return a GIF of a cat.

`http://bukkit.tangentialism.com/hello.gif`

![A random gif of a bear waving hello](http://bukk.it/hellobear.gif)

### `GET /MATCHABLE-WORD`

Returns a random image whose name includes _MATCHABLE-WORD_, irrespective of its format. So, `GET /dog` would return a random image of a dog, without a guarantee that it will be an awesome animated GIF.

**There are currently no plans for `PUT`, `POST`, or `DELETE` calls. Be happy this exists, and just pray that Ethan is available.**
